Course objectives:

Computational bottlenecks are frequently faced when dealing with large datasets. In life sciences, NGS datasets are frequently big and need specific processing softwares (e.g FastQC, Bowtie, TopHat, etc.).

For this purpose, it is useful to give the end users the opportunity to work on powerful machines having preinstalled specific softwares intended to their needs. This is possible using HPC cloud computing.

Many european countries have their own Clouds for scientific usage.

* Netherlands Cloud: Surf Sara (https://ui4.cloud.sara.nl/)
* Finnish Cloud: CSC- Center for Science (https://www.csc.fi/en)
* French Cloud: IFB - French Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/)

Unfortunately, users of every country should have access to their respective clusters which normally have their own interfaces and require specific knowledge.
