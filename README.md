Course objectives:

Computational bottlenecks are frequently faced when dealing with large datasets. In life sciences, NGS datasets are frequently big and need specific processing softwares (e.g FastQC, Bowtie, TopHat, etc.).

For this purpose, it is useful to give the end users the opportunity to work on powerful machines having preinstalled specific softwares intended to their needs. This is possible using HPC cloud computing.

Many european countries have their own Clouds for scientific usage.

* Netherlands Cloud: Surf Sara (https://ui4.cloud.sara.nl/)
* Finnish Cloud: CSC- Center for Science (https://www.csc.fi/en)
* French Cloud: IFB - French Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/)
* Switzerland Life Sciences Cluster: Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics - SIB (http://www.vital-it.ch/)

Unfortunately, users of every country should have access to their respective clusters which normally have their own interfaces and require specific knowledge.

Fortunately, course instructors will create accounts for you and will give you remote access via SSH.
You will basically learn how to manage your data on the cloud, learn how much computation power you need for your analysis.

Pre-requisite:

* The learners need to be familiar with basic UNIX command line.
* Windows users should have Git for windows installed - it provides a SHELL working environment. (https://msysgit.github.io/)
* For UNIX based styems users (UBUNTU, MAC OS), you just need your terminal application open.

What you will learn from this cousre:

* Connection to a distant machine (in this case it is your respective cloud)
* Moving data from your local machine to the cloud
* Make checks for space, quotas and other dependencies
* Install a software on the Cloud
* Run the Software on the data you already moved from your local machine
* Fetch back from the Cloud your output results when done and visualize on your local machine
