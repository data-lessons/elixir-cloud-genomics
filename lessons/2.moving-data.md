# Move data onto your instance

Once you have opened a connection to the remote host you can start your analysis. First of all you need to get the data (being sure you have enough space in your home folder).

## Disk usage and free space

As mentioned in the previous lesson, the `du` and `df` utilities are useful in disk usage analysis. The `du` utility gives informations about the occupied disk space, while the `df` gives informations on the free space on the current disk. Useful options to remember when running the `du` utility are `-h` and `-s`, they makes the output human readable while summarizing. If you need a more detailed output you can run the same command without the `-s` flag and the tool will return a list with the size of all the files in the current folder. To access the size of your home folder you can run:

```bash
$ du -sh
```

The `df` tool, on the other hand, gives you information about the free space on your disk. Again, the `-h` flag makes the output human readable. So, to check how much free space is in your machine just type:

```bash
$ df -h
```

Make sure you have at least 1G of free space in your home folder.

## Download the data

You can download the data as follows:

```
$ cd         # make sure you are in your own home directory
$ wget http://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/lgp/resource/Sample280.fastq.gz
```

In this case, you are using a command line tool, `wget`, to download content from a web server. This command supports downloading files from FTP and HTTP(s).  The tool `wget` also supports recursive download (with the `-r` flag), allowing you to download  complete folders and their contents.  For your information, there are other command line tools that can also be used to download data (e.g., `curl`,`rsync`), but `wget` should serve you well for the current lesson and other bioinformatics analyses.

## Moving files between your laptop and your instance

It is a common task to

If you're interested in transferring files on your computer to your instance, you can follow these operating-specific [instructions](http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2014/amazon/transfer-files-between-instance.html).
