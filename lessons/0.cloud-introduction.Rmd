### Why use a remote computer system?

 * Your own computer does not have enough resources to run the desired analysis (memory, processors, disk space, network bandwidth)
 * You cannot install software in your computer (application does not have support for your operating system, or conflicts with other existing applications)
 * You want to produce results faster than your computer can, for instance by ...
 * ... spreading the computational task over several machines running in parallel

### Some terms

 * Distributed system platform: software layers that facilitates coordination and management of a distributed system (e.g., queue-based system, and MapReduce)
 * Distributed system:
   * High Performance Computing (HPC): large assemble of physical machines and a homogeneous operating system (e.g., your institutions' HPC, XSEDE's HPC)
   * Cloud Computing: virtual machines, distributed platforms and/or applications offered as a service (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Computing)
 * Distributed application: a computer program that can be run simultaneously on several differnt computers (e.g., mpiBLAST)

 * Virtual machine (VM): a software computer running inside another computer (for flexibility and security)
 * Operating system (OS): the basic software layer that allows execution and management of applications. Typical examples are Windows, OSX (Mac) and Linux. 
 * Physical machine: the hardware (processors, memory, disk and network)


### HPC vs. Cloud:

| HPC | Cloud |
|:----|:------|
| User account on the system | root account on the system |
| Limited control of the system | Full control of the system |
| Central shared file system | Local file system |
| Jobs submitted into a queue | Jobs executed on each resource |
| Account-based isolation | OS-based isolation |
| Batch-oriented execution of applications | support for batch or interactive applications |
| Request for resource and time allocation | Pay-per-use |
| etc. | etc.|
