## Logging onto a cloud instance

Prerequisites:
* SSH client
* Knowledge about cyberinfrastructure
* Access to a cloud instance (in the form of a IP address)

Objectives:
*  Obtain the permission to access your cloud instance
*  Get the "address" of your cloud instance
*  Log in to your cloud instance

### Obtaining your own cloud instance address
Your instructors will provide you with a unique IP address which is the id of the virtual machine istance running in the cloud. On the Sara cloud, an example of a public IP is: 145.100.59.76. This address was obtained by configuring and instanciating a virtual machine on the Sara infrastructure. In this lesson, we will go through the necessary steps to connect to the machine and start exploring its content.

### Getting the "keys" for your cloud instance
Your instructors will provide you with a username and password. You will need to use or generate an RSA key to be able to connect to the virtual machine.

In Windows you can use [PuTTYgen](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) to generate a private/public key pair.

In Mac/Linux you can use the ssh-keygen utility:

`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C you.fav.email@provider.com`

You will need to use the credentials and the public key to log into the virtual machine.

### Logging into your cloud instance
The first step is getting the IP address of the machine to connect to and user credentials to use. 

If you have a Windows computer, you can use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) to quickly connect to the virtual machine. 

If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you can use the built-in terminal and the ssh program to establish the connection:

`$ ssh -i /path/to/id_rsa  username@123.456.1.1`

### Exercise

Obtain your public DNS and a permissions file and log into your personal cloud instance!
