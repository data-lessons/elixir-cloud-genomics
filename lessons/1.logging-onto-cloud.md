## Logging onto a cloud instance

Prerequisites:
* SSH client ([Git bash](https://msysgit.github.io/) for Windows)
* Knowledge about cyberinfrastructure
* Access to a cloud instance (in the form of a IP address)

Objectives:
*  Obtain the permission to access your cloud instance
*  Get the "address" of your cloud instance
*  Log in to your cloud instance

### Obtaining your own cloud instance address
Your instructors will provide you with a unique IP address which is the id of the virtual machine istance running in the cloud. An example of a public IP is: 145.100.59.76. This address is obtained by configuring and instanciating a virtual machine on the Sara infrastructure. The [Sara](https://surfsara.nl/) infrastructure is the national scientific cloud service in the Netherlands. In this lesson, we will go through the necessary steps to connect to the virtual machine and start playing around with that.

### Getting the "keys" for your cloud instance
Your instructors will provide you with a username and password. You will need to use an existing or generate a new RSA key to be able to connect to the virtual machine. In your terminal or in the Git Bash type:

`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C you.fav.email@provider.com`

By default ssh-keygen saves id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files in the .ssh folder under you home. Notice the dot in front of the name of the folder name, it is a hidden folder in your home!

You will need to use the credentials and the public key (id_rsa.pub) to log into the virtual machine.

### Logging into your cloud instance
The first step is getting the IP address of the machine to connect to and user credentials to use. Afterwards, use the ssh program to establish the connection:

`$ ssh -i /path/to/id_rsa  username@123.456.1.1`
